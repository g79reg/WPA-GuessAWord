# WPA-GuessAWord
Simple "Hangman" type game made with WPA to practice UI components, string operations and simple methods, created in order to put theory into practice.
Still in very early stages...
CheckForLetter() method seems to be long and doing to many things so will need to try to extract other methods from within. 
Plan to add a point system, level/score tracker and a highscore table.
May also add a graphic components (drawing a part of "hangman" with every lost live) and work out on overal presentation.
I should considery storing Buttons components in List/Array collections to allow simpler access and manipulation when required.
Once "completed" to playable and enjoyable state I should use it as a base to create GUI based "clone" version in Unity.
Will see where it ends in couple weeks/months...
